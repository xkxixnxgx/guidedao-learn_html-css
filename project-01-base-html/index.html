        David Jon Gilmour(born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist,
        singer, songwriter, and member of the rock band Pink Floyd.
        He joined as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1967,
        shortly before the departure of founding member Syd Barrett.
        Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums
        The Dark Side of the Moon (1973),
        Wish You Were Here (1975),
        Animals (1977),
        The Wall (1979),

        By the early 1980s, they had become one of the highest-selling and
        most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012,
        they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide,
        including 75 million in the United States.
        Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985,
        Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour's leadership and
        released three more studio albums.

        Gilmour credits guitarists such as Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Jeff Beck,
        Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, John Fahey, Roy Buchanan, and
        Hank Marvin of the Shadows as influences. Gilmour said,
        "I copied – don't be afraid to copy – and eventually something that 
        I suppose that I would call my own appeared."
        Writing for the magazine Far Out in 2022, Jordan Potter described Gilmour as 
        having a "unique and constantly developing guitar style" in Pink Floyd, 
        adding that "drawing from a healthy pool of influence, 
        he could devise his own characteristic style, recognised for 
        its sonorous gravity and pitch-perfect lead excursions, 
        which valued precision over speed." Gilmour's lead guitar style is characterised by 
        blues-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends, and sustain. In a 1985 interview, 
        he stated, "I can't play like Eddie Van Halen, I wish I could [...] 
        Sometimes I think I should work at the guitar more. 
        I play every day but I don't consciously practice scales or anything in particular.
        "In 2006, Gilmour added, "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound... [they] aren't very fast, 
        but I think I am instantly recognisable."[83] The Pink Floyd technician Phil Taylor said, 
        "It really is just his fingers, his vibrato, his choice of notes and 
        how he sets his effects ... In reality, no matter how well you duplicate the equipment, 
        you will never be able to duplicate the personality."

        The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, 
        released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. 
        It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual 
        self-imposed isolation from society forms a figurative wall. 
        The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and 
        reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, 
        many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as 
        one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the band's finest works.
        Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour, 
        modelling the character of Pink after himself and Pink Floyd's former songwriter Syd Barrett. 
        Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. 
        Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as 
        the band members were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. 
        The Wall was the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was 
        fired by Waters during production but stayed on as a salaried musician.
        Three singles were issued from the album: "Another Brick in the Wall, 
        Part 2" (Pink Floyd's only UK and US number-one single), "Run Like Hell", and 
        "Comfortably Numb". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed 
        the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. 
        In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film for which Waters wrote the screenplay.
        The Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. 
        With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band's catalogue 
        (behind The Dark Side of the Moon), the best selling double-album of all time, and 
        one of the best-selling albums of all time overall. 
        Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group's next album, 
        The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. 
        In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest albums of all time. 
        From 2010 to 2013, 
        Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician.
